# EDA-of-Wine-Quality-Data-in-Python
The main objective of this project is to explore the white wine quality dataset by conducting exploratory data analysis.
About Dataset:
The white wine quality dataset contains information about various attributes of white wines, with a focus on factors that might influence their quality. The dataset consists of a total of 4898 instances and 12 columns.
What I have done for EDA are the following:
1. Univariate analysis: Histogram for Each Variable
2. Univariate Analysis - Separate Boxplots for Each Variable
3. Bivariate Analysis: Scatter Diagrams
4. HEATMAP Analysis
5. Box Plot for Wine Quality vs. Alcohol Content
6. Scatter Plot for Alcohol Content vs. Volatile Acidity
7. Pair Plots
